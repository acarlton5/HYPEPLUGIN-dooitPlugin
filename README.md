# DooitPlugin (Dank Material Shell / Quickshell)

![Screenshot](./screenshots/image.png)

A small DMS (Dank Material Shell) / Quickshell plugin that displays your **Dooit** todo stats in the top bar and shows a popout with your todo lists.

It uses a **Python backend** to fetch todos from Dooit and returns a single JSON payload. The QML plugin executes that script periodically, parses the JSON, and renders:

- a **bar pill** with a todo counter
- a **popout** listing:
  - todos **due today or older**
  - the **5 oldest todos without a due date**

---

## Features

- ✅ Top-bar counter (updates every minute)
- 🧾 Popout view with todo lists
- 🐍 Python script output is JSON-only (safe for `JSON.parse`)
- 🔧 Works with DMS plugin folder deployment (copy/rsync)

---

## Project Structure

```
DooitPlugin/
├─ DooitPlugin.qml
├─ DooitPluginSettings.qml   # currently not in use
├─ plugin.json               # (or your manifest file)
└─ scripts/
   └─ dooit-collector.py     # Python backend (prints JSON)
```

---

## Requirements

- Dank Material Shell / Quickshell (DMS)
- Python 3
- Dooit Python API available for the Python interpreter used by DMS:
  - `dooit.api` must be importable

> If you’re using a virtual environment in your repo, make sure the plugin calls the venv’s Python executable.

---

## Installation

1) Copy the plugin into the DMS plugin directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins
cp -a DooitPlugin ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/
```

2) Reload plugins:

```bash
hype ipc call plugins reload DooitPlugin
```

Or restart DMS.

---

## Development Workflow (Recommended)

Because DMS may run as a systemd user service with restricted access (and symlinks to repo folders may not work),
a reliable workflow is to develop in your repo and sync into the DMS plugin folder:

```bash
rsync -a --delete ./DooitPlugin/ ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/DooitPlugin/ \
  && hype ipc call plugins reload DooitPlugin
```

---

## Configuration

### Python script path (relative)
The QML uses a relative path resolved from the plugin file location:

```qml
property string scriptPath: filePath(Qt.resolvedUrl("scripts/dooit-collector.py"))
```

### Output contract (Python → QML JSON)
The Python script must print exactly **one JSON object** on stdout:

```json
{
  "todoCount": "7",
  "todos": ["Todo A,true,null", "Todo B,true,14/02/2026"],
}
```
